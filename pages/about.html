        "Hello I am a Computer Science and Music student at Midwestern State University. I enjoy creating new things and collaborating with others. I built this website as an online
         portfolio and as a way to learn and practice web development. While working on this site, I have gained experience in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Currently, I am a junior in 
         college, and when I started, I had no prior experience in Computer Science. Outside of my studies, I love exploring new hobbies and sharing them with friends. 
         Recently, I have been enjoying Disc Golf and gaming. Thank you for taking the time to visit my website!
