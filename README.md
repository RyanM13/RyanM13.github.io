## Origin
I wanted to make a website to show my work and spark my creativity 
I thought of movies where they show the cliche hacker and thought it would be a fun 
idea to make something similar to that. So I went with the hacker-esque theme. 
Throughout this project, I learned HTML, CSS, and a little bit of JavaScript

## Technology used
